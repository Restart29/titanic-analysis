# Titanic Survival Analysis

A beginner-level data analysis project to predict survival on the Titanic, based on passenger characteristics.

This project explores the Titanic passenger dataset to identify survival patterns based on features like age, sex, and passenger class. The project involves data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and dashboarding using Python, Excel, and Power BI. It is designed to transition from guided learning to independent problem-solving.

## Project Objectives/Goals
- Transition from guided project to unguided project (to get comfortable).
- Able to form 'what questions to asks' questions from the dataset.
- Perform data cleaning using Python and/or Excel.
- Build visualizations to derive insight.
- Able to interpret and understand the plots.
- Design interactive dashboards in Power BI and Excel.
- Make a practice to create clean notes about the project.
